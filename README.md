2. A collection of samples ([standard](https://github.com/zugaldia/appython/blob/master/samples/standard/README.md) and [standard_with_vm](https://github.com/zugaldia/appython/blob/master/samples/standard_with_vm/README.md)) based on this library.

3. Scripts to help setting up and deploying these projects. [More information](https://github.com/zugaldia/appython/blob/master/scripts/README.md).
