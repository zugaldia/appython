# Appython scripts

This folder contains one script:

* `generate.py` uses the `appython` library to generate a bunch of random strings. In particular, the result of `generate_secret()` (called `key` in the output) is useful to set up the `SECRET_KEY` of the Flask app.

You can run it with:

```
$ python generate.py
```
